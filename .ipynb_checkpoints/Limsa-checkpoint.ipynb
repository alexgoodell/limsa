    "The transition from ``uninfected`` to any of the infected states is a function of how many people are infected with TB. This will be calculated dynamically, based on the estimated number of contacts and infectivity of contacts. In order to be able to use this data in the Go model, I've created a table called `Raw_inputs`. Let's save this information there. Each Raw_inputs row has a `value`, which represents its base value, as well as a verbose `name`, a `high` and `low`. In addition, there is a `slug`. This is a shortened version of the name, and it will be imported and accessable from the Go code. This is accomplished by begining the project setup with a Makefile (or setup.py) that writes a Go file importing these variables as slugs. Yes - the python program will *write* a Go program.\n",
